# AstarAndDijkstra_pathPlanning
An simple example of Dijkstra and A* algorithm use to compute a optimum path for given map

## Usage
Astar and Dijkstra algorithms takes the map from MapGeneration.py file which creat map object. Ony requirement here is to have a numpy array of occupency grid. Sample is provided in the main.py with maps
